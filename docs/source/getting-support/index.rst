Getting support
===============

There are multiple ways to get in touch with us, whether you want to get help using MythX, you want to develop an integration, or you want to give feedback.


Users
-----

You can connect with the MythX team on Discord at `#mythx-support <https://discord.gg/E3YrVtG>`_.

To get support for third-party tools it is usually best to communicate directly with the tool developers. For example:

* If you run into an issue with the :ref:`MythX plugin for Truffle <tooling.truffle>`, create an issue in its `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle-security>`_.
* For issues with the :ref:`MythX Remix plugin <tooling.remix>`, you can create an issue in the `Remix plugin GitHub repository <https://github.com/aquiladev/remix-mythx-plugin/>`_ as well.

For direct support, please go to `mythx.io <https://mythx.io>`_ and click the :guilabel:`Contact` link.
